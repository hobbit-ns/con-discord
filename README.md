# con-discord
Category/channel layout, starting from Philcon

While the Discord channel layout for virtual Philcon 2020 was pretty straightforward,
it still had too many channels, many of which were never used.  The "staff" areas in
particular could have been consolidated a lot better, and still have appropriate
role restrictions applied for tech, moderators, program crew, etc.
