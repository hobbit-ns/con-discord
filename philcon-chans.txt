## rough outline of Philcon channel layout
## Most of it hidden to anyone without "at con" type of role, which they
## get either via the CoC acceptance mechanism or manually by an admin.

## still a little too busy, I'd consolidate and re-order some categories

Category: welcome
 special chan: sign-the-coc, visible to @everyone, invokes role-bot
 chans:  ribbons, prog-books / documentation, need-roles

Category: helpdesk [could also be con ops with help-stuff under it]
  chans: help-requests, discord-help,  [!zoom-help], a help vox channel

Category: gaming
   several channels, per-game? or misc "round gaming table", square, etc

Category: fan tables
  many underneath per organization, give per-org "manage messages" maybe
  channels created on the fly as requested

Category: dealers
  many individual, plus a "dealer-help" place [move under ops/help?]
  perhaps some vox channels for general interactive use
  dealer-roles could "manage msgs" in category, mild risk of cross-oops

Category: artshow
  individual artists, and they could spam themselves however they like
  artists-roles could also "manage msgs" in category

Category: programming
  announcements, the run rooms, filk and media discuss, and media-disc vox
    posting restricted in announce

Category: social
  announce, consuite, party-board + -requests, bar-18+ [with bartenderbot!]
    posting restricted in announce
  general vox, and 18+ vox, scale quantity as needed
    [with the zoom-con-suite idea, far less need here]

Category: greenroom  ... might place under prog or con ops?
  greenroom itself, -help, and a vox channel
  program-participants can see/post

Category: volunteers -- sparsely utilized, only needed IRL?
  volunteer-lounge, and a vox

Category: staff -- very underutilized as such
  prog-planning, prog-ops [for run issues], and a vox

Category: tech
  announce, ops, socialize, post-panel-reports, and two vox [syd's war room]

Category: moderator hq
  incident-writeups [remained empty], mod-discuss which also served as the
    sort of alert channel,  mod-social for total fluff, and a "serious" vox
  discord server admins would logically hang here or under "tech" too

Category: admin
  chan: arrivals, can set server to drop join notifications here
    nobody can actually *post* to it, just to collect server msgs
    this chan can optionally be externally visible, under "social"?

## all in all, still way too many compartments.  Consolidation could easily
## have happened with tech/mods/prog-ops under "staff", with maybe "mods"
## separated away, but really, do mods need any more than one non-sync??

## basic role classes, excluding "ribbons", flags, discord puzzle-hunts

admin : everything, speaker-to-bots if needed, maybe "registration"
moderator : manage-messages, manage-roles, *not* manage-channels
bot : permissions as needed, not necessarily manage-server
penalty : specific DENIES to vox channels, deny view/post in some text areas
tech, tech-leads : staff/tech access
ops, program-ops : staff/greenroom access
program-participant : greenroom access
artist / artshow : manage in artist-area
dealer : manage in dealer-area
attendee : access most general con areas
@everyone : only see welcome / CoC / help-get-me-started channel
